## Overview

The Amazon Redshift connector provides comprehensive integration with AWS's cloud data warehouse service, offering deep metadata discovery, query analysis, and seamless authentication with AWS services.

### Supported Features

- ✅ **Metadata Discovery**: Complete schema, table, and column discovery
- ✅ **Query Usage**: Query logs analysis and usage patterns
- ✅ **Data Profiler**: Statistical analysis and data profiling
- ✅ **Data Quality**: Custom quality tests and continuous monitoring
- ✅ **dbt Integration**: Native dbt model and lineage support
- ✅ **Data Lineage**: Table and view relationship tracking
- ✅ **Column-level Lineage**: Detailed column dependency mapping
- ✅ **Stored Procedures**: Procedure discovery and metadata
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Data sampling for analysis and preview
- ✅ **Auto-Classification**: Automated data classification and PII detection
- ✅ **Incremental Extraction**: Efficient incremental metadata updates
- ✅ **SSL Support**: Secure connections with SSL/TLS

### Limitations

- ❌ **Owners**: Owner information extraction not supported
- ❌ **Tags**: Tag metadata extraction not supported

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Redshift connector.

## Requirements

### Metadata
Redshift user must grant `SELECT` privilege on table [SVV_TABLE_INFO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVV_TABLE_INFO.html) to fetch the metadata of tables and views. For more information visit [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_visibility-of-data.html).

```sql
-- Create a new user
-- More details https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_USER.html
CREATE USER test_user with PASSWORD 'password';

-- Grant SELECT on table
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE svv_table_info to test_user;
```

<Accordion title="Schema Usage Privileges">
Ensure that the ingestion user has **USAGE** privileges on the schema containing the views. If additional access is needed, run the following command:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<schema_name>" TO <ingestion_user>;
```
</Accordion>

### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/workflow) and data quality tests [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality).

### Usage & Lineage
For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege on `STL_QUERY` table. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).

## Metadata Ingestion

All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas. Here you can find the structure to create a connection to Redshift.

### 1. Visit the Services Page

The first step is to ingest the metadata from your sources. Under Settings, you will find a Services link an external source system to Collate. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.

To visit the Services page, select Services from the Settings menu.

### 2. Create a New Service

Click on the Add New Service button to start the Service creation.

### 3. Select the Service Type

Select Redshift as the service type and click Next.

### 4. Name and Describe your Service

Provide a name and description for your service as illustrated below.

It is recommended to exclude the schema "information_schema" from the metadata ingestion as it contains system tables and views.

#### Connection Details

- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Redshift. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Redshift.
- **Database**: The database of the data source is an optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. If left blank, Collate ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.

<Accordion title="Distribution Style Note">
During the metadata ingestion for redshift, the tables in which the distribution style i.e, `DISTSTYLE` is not `AUTO` will be marked as partitioned tables
</Accordion>

**SSL Configuration**

In order to integrate SSL in the Metadata Ingestion Config, the user will have to add the SSL config under connectionArguments which is placed in the source.

**SSL Modes**

There are a couple of types of SSL modes that Redshift supports which can be added to ConnectionArguments, they are as follows:
- **disable**: SSL is disabled and the connection is not encrypted.

- **allow**: SSL is used if the server requires it.

- **prefer**: SSL is used if the server supports it. Amazon Redshift supports SSL, so SSL is used when you set sslmode to prefer.

- **require**: SSL is required.

- **verify-ca**: SSL must be used and the server certificate must be verified.

- **verify-full**: SSL must be used. The server certificate must be verified and the server hostname must match the hostname attribute on the certificate.

For more information, you can visit [Redshift SSL documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-ssl-support.html)

## Securing Redshift Connection with SSL in Collate

To establish secure connections between Collate and a Redshift database, you can configure SSL using different SSL modes provided by Redshift, each offering varying levels of security.

Under `Advanced Config`, specify the SSL mode appropriate for your connection, such as `prefer`, `verify-ca`, `allow`, and others. After selecting the SSL mode, provide the CA certificate used for SSL validation (`caCertificate`). Note that Redshift requires only the CA certificate for SSL validation.

## Reverse Metadata

*This feature is available in Collate only.*

The Reverse Metadata feature allows you to push metadata changes from Collate back to Redshift, ensuring your source system stays synchronized with any updates made in the data catalog.
