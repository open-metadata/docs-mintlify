# Auth0 SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up Auth0 SSO.

<Accordion title="Security Requirements for Production">
Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth) enabled before configuring the authentication with Auth0 SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens). The keys we provide by default are aimed only for quickstart and testing purposes. They should NEVER be used in a production installation.
</Accordion>

## Create Server Credentials

### Step 1: Create the Account

- If you don't have an account, [Sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) to create one.
- Select the Account Type, i.e., Company or Personal
- Click I need advanced settings and click next.

- Provide the Tenant Domain, select the region and click on Create Account.

- Once done, you will land on the dashboard page.

### Step 2: Create Server Credentials

## Choose Your Authentication Flow

After creating the account, choose the authentication flow you want to use:

- [Implicit Flow](/deployment/security/auth0/implicit-flow) (Public)
- [Auth Code Flow](/deployment/security/auth0/auth-code-flow) (Confidential)

<Accordion title="Application Types and Authentication Flows">
- **SPA (Single Page Application):**
  This type is designed for implicit flows. In this case, providing both the client ID and client secret will result in a failure because the implicit flow only requires the client ID for authentication.

- **Web:**
  This type is intended for confidential clients. If you select this option, you must provide both the client ID and client secret. Simply passing the client ID will cause the authorization process to fail, as the Authorization Code flow requires both credentials for successful authentication.
  The [OIDC Authorization Code Flow](/deployment/security/oidc) is used in this case, where the client secret is required to securely exchange the authorization code for tokens.

### Recommendation:

- Use the **Web** type for confidential clients that require both a client ID and secret.
- Use the **SPA** type for applications using implicit flows where only a client ID is needed.
</Accordion>

## Auth Code Flow Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Application

- Once you are on the Dashboard page, click on `Applications > Applications` available on the left-hand side panel.

- Click on `Create Application`.

- Enter the Application name.
- Choose an application type and click on `Create`.

### Step 2: Where to Find the Credentials

- Navigate to the Settings tab.
- You will find your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

After applying these steps, you can update the configuration of your deployment:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Docker Security" icon="docker" href="/deployment/security/auth0/docker">
    Configure Auth0 SSO for your Docker Deployment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bare Metal Security" icon="server" href="/deployment/security/auth0/bare-metal">
    Configure Auth0 SSO for your Bare Metal Deployment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kubernetes Security" icon="kubernetes" href="/deployment/security/auth0/kubernetes">
    Configure Auth0 SSO for your Kubernetes Deployment.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration Examples

### Auth Code Flow Configuration

```yaml
authenticationConfiguration:
  provider: "auth0"
  authority: "https://your-domain.auth0.com/"
  clientId: "${AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}"
  clientSecret: "${AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET}"
  callbackUrl: "${AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL}"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Auth0 Configuration
AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER=auth0
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-auth0-client-secret
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8585/callback
```

### Implicit Flow Configuration

```yaml
authenticationConfiguration:
  provider: "auth0"
  authority: "https://your-domain.auth0.com/"
  clientId: "${AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}"
  callbackUrl: "${AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL}"
```

## Required Auth0 Settings

### Application Settings

In your Auth0 application settings, configure:

- **Application Type**: Web Application (for Auth Code Flow) or Single Page Application (for Implicit Flow)
- **Allowed Callback URLs**: `https://your-domain.com/callback`
- **Allowed Logout URLs**: `https://your-domain.com/`
- **Allowed Web Origins**: `https://your-domain.com`

### API Configuration

If using Auth Code Flow, you may need to configure an API in Auth0:

1. Go to Applications > APIs
2. Create a new API
3. Set the identifier (audience)
4. Configure scopes as needed

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Invalid callback URL">
Ensure your callback URLs in Auth0 application settings match exactly with your Collate deployment URLs:
- Production: `https://your-domain.com/callback`
- Development: `http://localhost:8585/callback`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client authentication failed">
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correctly configured
- For Web applications, ensure both Client ID and Client Secret are provided
- For SPA applications, ensure only Client ID is used
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid audience">
- Check that your Auth0 API identifier matches the configured audience
- Verify the API is enabled and properly configured
- Ensure the application has access to the API
</Accordion>
