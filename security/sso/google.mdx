# Google SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up Google SSO.

<Accordion title="Security Requirements for Production">
Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth) enabled before configuring the authentication with Google SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens). The keys we provide by default are aimed only for quickstart and testing purposes. They should NEVER be used in a production installation.
</Accordion>

## Create Server Credentials

### Step 1: Create the Account
- Go to [Create Google Cloud Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Click on `Create Project`

### Step 2: Create a New Project
Enter the **Project name**.
Enter the parent organization or folder in the **Location box**. That resource will be the hierarchical parent of the new project.
Click **Create**.

### Step 3: How to Configure OAuth Consent
- Select the project you created above and click on **APIs & Services** on the left-side panel.

- Click on the **OAuth Consent Screen** available on the left-hand side panel.
- Choose User Type **Internal**.

- Once the user type is selected, provide the **App Information** and other details.
- Click **Save and Continue**.

- On the **Scopes Screen**, Click on **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES** and select the scopes.
- Once done click on **Update**.

- Click **Save and Continue**.

- Click on **Back to Dashboard**.

### Step 4: Create Credentials for the Project
- Once the OAuth Consent is configured, click on **Credentials** available on the left-hand side panel.

- Click on **Create Credentials**
- Select **OAuth client ID** from the dropdown.

- Once selected, you will be asked to select the **Application type**. Select **Web application**.

After selecting the **Application Type**, name your project and give the authorized URIs:
  - domain/callback
  - domain/silent-callback

- Click **Create**
- You will get the credentials

### Step 5: Where to Find the Credentials
- Go to **Credentials**
- Click on the **pencil icon (Edit OAuth Client)** on the right side of the screen

- You will find the **Client ID** in the top right corner

After applying these steps, you can update the configuration of your deployment:

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Google SSO Configuration

```yaml
authenticationConfiguration:
  provider: "google"
  publicKeyUrls:
    - "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
  authority: "https://accounts.google.com"
  clientId: "${GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID}"
  callbackUrl: "${GOOGLE_SSO_CALLBACK_URL}"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Google SSO Configuration
AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER=google
GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_SSO_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8585/callback
```

## Scopes Required

The following OAuth scopes are required for Google SSO integration:

- `openid` - Basic user identification
- `email` - Access to user email address
- `profile` - Access to basic profile information

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Invalid redirect URI">
Ensure your redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console match exactly with your Collate deployment URLs:
- Production: `https://your-domain.com/callback`
- Development: `http://localhost:8585/callback`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unauthorized client">
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correctly configured
- Ensure the OAuth consent screen is properly configured
- Check that your application is published if using external user type
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access denied">
- Verify the user has access to the Google Workspace domain
- Check that required scopes are granted
- Ensure the user type (Internal/External) matches your setup
